;Button nested logic -> we should have buttons constantly checking in the main loop for a stop (i.e the stop should be instantaneous)
        ;->Buttons should allow for adjustment of soak temp, soak time, reflow temp, reflow time (Ui should be designed to make all these visible and clear)
        ;->Start button should either be used only for start or used for start/stop (we could also maybe implement a pause button)
